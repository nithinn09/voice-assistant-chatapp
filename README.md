## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text using IBM Watson Speech-to-Text.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo for understanding and generating human-like responses.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Transforms text responses back into speech for a complete conversational experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and engaging UI.
- **Full-Stack Application**: Integrates front-end and back-end seamlessly using Flask.
- **Containerization**: Uses Docker for easy deployment and management of application dependencies.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates a variety of technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for backend development.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the server-side of the application.
- **Docker**: For containerization, ensuring consistent environments across different setups.
- **OpenAI API**: To access GPT-3.5 Turbo for generating intelligent responses.
- **IBM Watson**: For both speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For building a dynamic and interactive user interface.

## Installation

To get started with the Voice Assistant ChatApp, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nithinn09/voice-assistant-chatapp.git
   cd voice-assistant-chatapp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Python and Docker installed. You can then install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI and IBM Watson credentials:

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   IBM_WATSON_API_KEY=your_ibm_watson_api_key
   IBM_WATSON_URL=your_ibm_watson_url
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:

   You can run the application using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   Alternatively, if you prefer running it locally without Docker, use:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to start using the voice assistant.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the voice assistant by clicking the microphone icon. Speak your queries, and the assistant will respond with text and speech. Here are some example commands you can try:

- "What is the weather today?"
- "Tell me a joke."
- "Set a timer for 10 minutes."

Feel free to explore different types of questions and commands to see how the assistant responds.
